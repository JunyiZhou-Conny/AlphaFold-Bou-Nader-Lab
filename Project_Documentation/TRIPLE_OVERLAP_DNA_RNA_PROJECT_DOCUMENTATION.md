           pass
   ```

2. **Multi-Dataset Overlap Analysis:**
   ```python
   # Add to alphafold_core/analysis/overlap.py
   class MultiDatasetOverlapAnalyzer:
       def analyze_multiple_datasets(self, datasets, labels):
           # Implement comprehensive overlap analysis
           pass
   ```

3. **External Dataset Comparison:**
   ```python
   # Add to alphafold_core/analysis/overlap.py
   def compare_with_external_dataset(self, master_data, external_data):
       # Implement Dicer-like comparison functionality
       pass
   ```

4. **File Processing Utilities:**
   ```python
   # Add to alphafold_core/utils.py
   def rename_files_by_pattern(self, directory, pattern, replacement):
       # Implement file renaming utilities
       pass
   ```

### **Benefits of Migration:**
- ✅ **Reusable Components:** Complex gene querying strategies become reusable
- ✅ **Standardized Processing:** Consistent handling of different data structures
- ✅ **Enhanced Error Handling:** Better error recovery and reporting
- ✅ **Configuration Management:** Centralized configuration for different datasets
- ✅ **Comprehensive Testing:** Testable components with clear interfaces
